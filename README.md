# Guessing game in Python:
This is a small project to apply some of the skills I learned into one complete python project.
Tho the idea of a guessing gmae might be simple, the focuse is on using differet solutions and best practices, like Binary search for the pc to guess the users number.

I will also create a GUI for this game to learn more about the complete life cycle of a project in such a scale, and re-iterate on it.
